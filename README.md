# FocusTimer

After watching a Youtube video regarding 'The Ideal Length of Time for Focused Work' by Dr. Andrew Huberman @ [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HINgMMTzPE&loop=0.] <br />
I thought it was a simple and good practice for me to create a timer using Java. <br />
Java program to add time by 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, or 90 mins and it'll beep (will be added soon) when time is 0. <br />
User can hit '*START*' button then the button will turn into '*STOP*' button and time will count down. Vice versa. <br />
'*RESET*' button will reset the time to 0 and stop counting. <br />
User can add time in the middle of count down. <br />
